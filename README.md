# AutoHotkey-Scripts
AutoHotkey - Volume Controls using "Screen Lock" and "Pause Break"

Script 1 (AutohotkeyVolume.ahk): This script changes the Windows volume up or down by 2 actions (or 4 units, as the sound is adjusted by 2/ea). This script is tied to the PAUSE/BREAK key and the SCROLL LOCK key.

Script 2 (VolumeOutput.ahk): This script opens up the Windows Sound Playback tab and changes the playback device - the device is changed either to the 1st device or 2nd device. These commands are tied to the PAUSE/BREAK key and the SCROLL LOCK key. To activate them, hold CTRL and then one of the keys. Then the Sound window is closed.
